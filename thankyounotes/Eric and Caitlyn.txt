Dear Eric and Caitlyn, 

We are so happy you could be part of our wedding celebration. 

Thank you so much for the napkins, ice cream scoop, aspen serving bowl. We can't wait to use it for Caitlyn you were right the ice cream scoop is a game changer!. 

Lindsay wants to do a boys + wives trip soon. Maybe PV? 

We hope you had a great time at the wedding, thank you again! 

Love Patrick and Lindsay
