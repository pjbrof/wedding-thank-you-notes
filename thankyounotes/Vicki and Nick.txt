Dear Vicki and Nick, 

We are so happy you could be part of our wedding celebration. 

Thank you so much for the generous cash gift. We're getting settled into our new home as newlyweds, and plan on using it for some much needed improvements to make the home our own. 

We had such a good time at your wedding, a little embaressed you beat me Vicki to getting these thank you's out even with a two month head start. 

We hope you had a great time at the wedding, thank you again! 

Love Patrick and Lindsay
