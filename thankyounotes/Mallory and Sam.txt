Dear Mallory and Sam, 

We are so happy you could be part of our wedding celebration. 

Thank you so much for the dutch oven. We can't wait to use it for baking bread. We've already used it a bunch and love it.. 

Hope you guys are enjoying the cabin life up in New Hampshire. 

We hope you had a great time at the wedding, thank you again! 

Love Patrick and Lindsay
