Dear Uncle Tim and Aunt Debbie, 

We are so happy you could be part of our wedding celebration. 

Thank you so much for the generous cash gift. We're getting settled into our new home as newlyweds, and plan on using it for some much needed improvements to make the home our own. 

 

We hope you had a great time at the wedding, thank you again! 

Love Patrick and Lindsay
