Dear Caitlin and Caleb, 

We're sorry you couldn't make it to the wedding, but we wanted to thank you for sending the Dinner Plates. We're still getting settled into our new home as newlyweds and these are the perfect addition. 

Hope everything is going well with the twins and your life in Cinci. Miss you guys. 

We wish you could have been there to celebrate with us. 

Love Patrick and Lindsay
