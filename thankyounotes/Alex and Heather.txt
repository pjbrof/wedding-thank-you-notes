Dear Alex and Heather, 

We're sorry you couldn't make it to the wedding, but we wanted to thank you for sending the beer glasses. We can't wait to use it for throwing back natty lights. Just kidding I have a more refined palate now, I've upgrade to Bud Light.. 

 

We miss you guys, we wish you could have been there to celebrate with us! 

Love Patrick and Lindsay
